Disaster Response Web-Application

This aplication estimates the message intent category from disaster messages.
It consists of the following three configurations.

### Project Components：   
1.ETL Pipeline   
-Loads the messages and categories datasets  
-Merges the two datasets  
-leans the data -tores it in a SQLite database  

2.ML Pipeline：  
-Loads data from the SQLite database  
-Splits the dataset into training and test sets  
-Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline  
-Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV -Outputs results on the test set  
-Exports the final model as a pickle file  

3.Flask Web App  


### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`
